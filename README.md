Before we dive into how you can get YouTube Premium for free, let's take a moment to understand what YouTube Premium offers.

## **How to Get YouTube Premium for Free: 5 Methods to Try**

While YouTube Premium is a paid service, there are ways to enjoy some of its benefits without paying a cent. Let's look at some methods to access YouTube Premium features for free.

### **1. YouTube Premium Free Trial**

YouTube offers a free trial of its Premium service for new users. This trial typically lasts for 1 month, but in some cases, it may be extended.

#### **How to Sign Up for the Free Trial:**
1. Open the YouTube app or website.
2. Click on your profile icon.
3. Select ‚ÄúGet YouTube Premium.‚Äù
4. Follow the steps to sign up for the free trial.

During the free trial, you‚Äôll enjoy all the perks of YouTube Premium, including ad-free videos, background play, and YouTube Music.

### **2. YouTube Music Free Trial**

If you‚Äôre primarily interested in music, YouTube also offers a free trial for YouTube Music Premium. This can be a great option if you want to enjoy ad-free music and offline listening for a month.

#### **How to Get YouTube Music Free Trial:**
1. Open the YouTube Music app or go to the website.
2. Click on your profile icon.
3. Tap on ‚ÄúTry YouTube Music Premium free for 1 month.‚Äù

### **3. Sharing YouTube Premium with Family or Friends**

YouTube Premium allows users to share their subscription with up to 5 family members. If a friend or family member already has YouTube Premium, you may be able to join their plan and enjoy all the benefits for free.

#### **How to Share YouTube Premium with Family:**
1. The primary account holder needs to go to the ‚ÄúPaid memberships‚Äù section in YouTube settings.
2. Invite family members via email to join the plan.

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be invited, you can enjoy YouTube Premium without paying a subscription fee.

### **4. YouTube Premium for Students**

Are you a student? YouTube offers a special discounted rate for students, which makes it more affordable. But, if you find a way to access a free trial or a discount, you might be able to enjoy the benefits for a limited time without paying at all.

#### **How to Get YouTube Premium Student Discount:**
1. Visit the YouTube Premium Student page.
2. Sign up using your university email address.
3. Get access to a special student discount rate (usually 50% off).

### **5. YouTube Premium Alternative Services**

Some third-party apps and services offer similar benefits to YouTube Premium for free. These alternatives may not offer all the features of YouTube Premium, but they can still enhance your YouTube experience.

#### **Examples of Alternatives:**
- **NewPipe**: A free, open-source app that removes ads from YouTube and offers background playback.
- **YT Vanced**: An unofficial app that offers ad-free YouTube viewing, background play, and more (note: this app is not available on official app stores, so it requires additional steps to install).

### **Are These Methods Legal?**

You might wonder if these methods are legal. The official YouTube free trials and family sharing features are completely legal, as they are provided by YouTube itself. However, third-party apps like NewPipe and YT Vanced may not be officially endorsed by YouTube and could violate YouTube‚Äôs terms of service.

It's important to always review the terms and conditions and consider the risks before using any unofficial methods.

## **Benefits of YouTube Premium (Paid Version)**

While there are ways to access YouTube Premium features for free, it‚Äôs also worth considering the benefits of paying for YouTube Premium.

### **1. Support Your Favorite Creators**
By subscribing to YouTube Premium, you're helping support creators you love. Since YouTube Premium members don‚Äôt see ads, creators are paid through the subscription fees.

### **2. Access to YouTube Originals**
YouTube Originals are exclusive shows and movies made by top creators and celebrities. Paying for YouTube Premium gives you full access to this unique content.

### **3. High-Quality Playback**
YouTube Premium offers higher video quality, including 4K support on select devices. If you're a fan of high-definition content, this is a big plus.

## **How to Get the Most Out of Your Free YouTube Premium Experience**

Whether you're trying out YouTube Premium for the first time or using a family account, here are some tips to make the most of it.

### **1. Download Videos for Offline Viewing**
Take advantage of the offline viewing feature by downloading your favorite videos to watch later, even when you don't have an internet connection.

### **2. Try YouTube Music**
If you‚Äôre a music lover, YouTube Music Premium is a great way to discover new tracks and listen without interruptions. You can also download music for offline listening.

### **3. Explore YouTube Originals**
Don't miss out on exclusive shows and documentaries available only to YouTube Premium members. It‚Äôs an added bonus to your subscription.

### **4. Create Playlists for Easy Access**
Organize your favorite videos into playlists for quick access. You can easily create playlists for music, tutorials, and other content you enjoy.

## **What Happens After Your Free Trial Ends?**

Once your free trial ends, you‚Äôll be automatically charged unless you cancel the trial beforehand. If you don‚Äôt want to continue with the paid subscription, make sure to cancel your trial before the renewal date to avoid charges.

## **Is YouTube Premium Worth It?**

If you‚Äôre someone who watches YouTube frequently, YouTube Premium is definitely worth considering. The ad-free experience, the ability to play videos in the background, and the perks of YouTube Music are all valuable features. However, if you‚Äôre only a casual viewer, you might find that the free alternatives are good enough.
